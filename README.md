# Nonnegative Matrix Factorization on LFW Dataset

This project applies **Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** to face images from the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. It includes a custom implementation of the multiplicative updates algorithm by Lee and Seung, along with a thorough analysis of sparsity, reconstruction error, and visual interpretation of learned features.

## Repository Structure

-  Main analysis notebook: data loading, NMF training, visualization of results, etc.
-  Final write-up containing explanation of methods and results.
-  Helper functions and the custom  class implementing the algorithm.

## Highlights

- Implementation of multiplicative updates for NMF
- Application to a dataset of 1288 grayscale face images (50Ã—37 pixels)
- Analysis of reconstruction error vs. rank
- Study of sparsity in the learned factor matrices  and 
- Visualization of learned basis components and image reconstructions
